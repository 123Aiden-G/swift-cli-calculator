# Swift CLI Calculator

![Swift](https://img.shields.io/badge/Swift-FA7343?style=for-the-badge&logo=swift&logoColor=white)

A simple command-line calculator built in Swift.  
This is my first Swift project — a small but fun way to learn the language.

## Features
- Basic arithmetic: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Input validation (handles invalid numbers and division by zero)
- Clean CLI interface
- Easily extendable for new operations

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/swift-cli-calculator.git
